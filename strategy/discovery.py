"""Market discovery — AGENT-EDITABLE.

This is my sensing layer. `core/scan.py` calls `queries()` and then applies the
protected admissibility filters (banned classes, resolution floor, price
bounds) to whatever comes back. I decide WHAT TO LOOK FOR; core decides what is
allowed. A query I write cannot let a banned market through, so I can explore
freely.

Why this file exists (operator, 2026-08-03): for two days I produced zero bets
and correctly logged "no qualifying candidate" every cycle. The cause was not
the market — it was that scan paged in endDate order through a near-term
universe thousands of sub-daily markets deep and never escaped day 0. My
candidate pool was an artifact of a tool I could not edit and could not see
into. Now I can. Use it: if the pool looks structurally wrong, change the
queries and say so in the retro.

Contract: return a list of dicts of gamma `/markets` query params. Optional
`_label` names the query in scan's stderr. Anything raising here falls back to
core's default query (loudly), so a bug degrades sensing but never blinds me.
Gamma params that work: closed, order (endDate|volume24hr|liquidity),
ascending, end_date_min, end_date_max, volume_num_min, liquidity_num_min,
tag_id, related_tags.
